mime4lighttpd
===============

I was struggling with MIME-types for Lighttpd.  The samples on the web weren't working for my FastCGI application.  I
found a complete MIME types files for ngnix, so I wrote this script to convert it to Lighttpd.

Syntax:

    mime4lighttpd /path/to/nginx/mime.types

You will get a file called "mime.out".  Cat that into your Lighttpd file.
